# Udacity DataAnalyst Nanodegree Projects(2017)

6 projects associated with Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. Skills used for those projects include data operations with numpy and Pandas, visualizations using matplotlib. R programming and its visualization tool ggplot2 were also used in similar tasks. Python were used for parsing json and xml object in some of data wrangling projects. sklearn toolkits were used in machine learning project. Tableau was used for some of interactive data visualization tasks.  

**Full jupyter notebook of each project can be found in each folder.** 


## Individual project description
**Project 0:** Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data (prep project for the nanodegree, a walkthrough of data analysis using Bay Area Bike Share Data as an example, a warm up for python, numpy, pandas and matplotlib).  

**Project 1:** Test a Perceptual Phenomenon. This project is to use statistical inference to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. Basic statistical parameters were calculated based on the given data, a paired t test was used for hypothesis testing.

**Project 2:** Investigate Titanic Survival Data. This project is to use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to investigate Titanic Survival Data and communicate the discoveries using visualization. The goal of this project is to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

**Project 3:** Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data. This project is to first parse data queried from https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world(in my case, Tampa, FL). Finally, use SQL as the data schema to store the information. The goal of this project is to practice parsing and gathering data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html, processing data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically, and to learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB or SQL.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
